1. You want to find the stadium where player 'Dimitris Salpingidis' scored. Select the JOIN condition to use:

select stadium 
  from game join goal on (id=matchid)
  where player='Dimitris Salpingidis'
  
2. You JOIN the tables goal and eteam in an SQL statement. Indicate the list of column names that may be used in the SELECT line:

select matchid, teamid, player, gtime, id, teamname, coach
  from goal join eteam on (teamid=id)
  

3. Select the code which shows players, their team and the amount of goals they scored against Greece(GRE).

select player, teamid, count(*)
  from game join goal on (id=matchid)
  where (team1='gre' or team2='gre')
    and teamid!='gre'
  group by player, teamid
  
  SELECT player, teamid, COUNT(*)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
 WHERE (team1 = "GRE" OR team2 = "GRE")
   AND teamid != 'GRE'
 GROUP BY player, teamid
 
 4. Select the result that would be obtained from this code:
SELECT DISTINCT teamid, mdate
  FROM goal JOIN game on (matchid=id)
 WHERE mdate = '9 June 2012'
 
 result:
 
 DEN	9 June 2012
 GER	9 June 2012

  
5. Select the code which would show the player and their team for those who have scored against Poland(POL) in National Stadium, Warsaw.
 
select player, teamid
  from game join goal on (id=matchid)
    where (team1='pol' or team2='pol')
      and teamid!='pol'
      and stadium='National stadium, warsaw'
      
   SELECT DISTINCT player, teamid 
   FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
  WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw' 
 AND (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
   AND teamid != 'POL'


6. Select the code which shows the player, their team and the time they scored, for players who have played in Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw) but not against Italy(ITA).

select player, teamid, gtime
  from game join goal on (id=matchid)
    where ((teamid=team1 and team2!='ita') or (teamid=team2 and team1!='ita'))
          and stadium='Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw)'
        
  
 SELECT DISTINCT player, teamid, gtime
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
 WHERE stadium = 'Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw)'
   AND (( teamid = team2 AND team1 != 'ITA') OR ( teamid = team1 and team2!='ita'))
