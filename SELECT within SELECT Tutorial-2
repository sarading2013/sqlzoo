4.
Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.

select name, population from world
where population between 
   (select population+1 from world
   where name='canada') 
   and
   (select population-1 from world
   where name='poland')

5.
Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
The format should be Name, Percentage for example:

name	percentage
Albania	3%
Andorra	0%
Austria	11%
...	...

Decimal places
You can use the function ROUND to remove the decimal places.
Percent symbol %
You can use the function CONCAT to add the percentage symbol.

select name, concat(round(100*population/(select population from world where name='germany')), '%')from world
where continent='europe'

6.
To gain an absurdly detailed view of one insignificant feature of the language, read on.
We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list. For example, you can find the largest country in the world, by population with this query:

SELECT name
  FROM world
 WHERE population >= ALL(SELECT population
                           FROM world
                          WHERE population>0)
You need the condition population>0 in the sub-query as some countries have null for population.

Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

select name from world 
where gdp > 
  all(select gdp from world
      where continent='europe'
      and gdp>0)
      
7.
We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the inner and outer versions.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

select continent, name, area from world x
where area >=
  all(select area from world y
      where x.continent = y.continent
      and area>0)

Note: One way to interpret the line in the WHERE clause that references the two table is “… where the correlated values are the same”.
In the example provided, you would say “select the country details from world where the area is greater than or equal to the 
area of all countries where the continent is the same”.

8.
List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

select continent, name from world x
where name <= 
  all(select name from world y
      where x.continent=y.continent
      order by name)
      
9.
Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents.
Show name, continent and population.

select name, continent, population from world x
where 25000000 >= 
     all (select population from world y
     where
     x.continent=y.continent)
      
10.
Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

select name, continent from world x
where population/3 >
  all (select population from world y
       where x.continent= y.continent
       and y.name!=x.name)
