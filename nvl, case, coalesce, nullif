1 NVL

NVL takes two arguments and returns the first value that is not null.

   NVL(x,y) = x if x is not NULL
   NVL(x,y) = y if x is NULL
   
  example 1.
NVL can be useful when you want to replace a NULL value with some other value. In this example you show the name of the party 
for each MSP that has a party. For the MSP with no party (such as Canavan, Dennis) you show the string None.

select name, party
  , coalesce (party, 'none') as aff
  from msg  
  where name like 'c%'


2 CASE

CASE allows you to return different values under different conditions.

If none of the conditions match (and there is not ELSE) then NULL is returned.

  CASE WHEN condition1 THEN value1 
       WHEN condition2 THEN value2  
       ELSE def_value 
  END 
  
 example 1. 
 select mdate, team1
  , sum(case when teamid=team1 then 1 else 0 end) score1
  team2
  , sum(case when teamid=team2 then 1 else 0 end) score2
  end
  from game left join goal on (matchid=id)
  group by mdate, matchid, team1, team2
  
  
  example 2.
  select name, population
   , case when population <1000000
               then 'small'
          when population <10000000
               then 'medium'
          else 'large'
     end
  from world
 
 
  3 coalesce
  
  COALESCE takes any number of arguments and returns the first value that is not null.

  COALESCE(x,y,z) = x if x is not NULL
  COALESCE(x,y,z) = y if x is NULL and y is not NULL
  COALESCE(x,y,z) = z if x and y are NULL but z is not NULL
  COALESCE(x,y,z) = NULL if x and y and z are all NULL
  
  example 1.
COALESCE can be useful when you want to replace a NULL value with some other value. In this example you show the name of the party for each MSP that has a party. 
For the MSP with no party (such as Canavan, Dennis) you show the string None.

select name, party 
    , coalesce (party, 'none') as aff
 from msp
 where name like 'c%'
 
 
 4 nullif
 
 NULLIF returns NULL if the two arguments are equal; otherwise NULLIF returns the first argument.

   NULLIF(x,y) = NULL if x=y
   NULLIF(x,y) = x if x != y     
   
   example 1.
   select name, party 
       , nullif (party, 'lab') as aff
     from msp
     where name like 'c%'
     
    Result:
name	party	aff
Campbell MSP, Colin	SNP	SNP
Canavan MSP, Dennis	null	null
Chisholm MSP, Malcolm	Lab	null
Craigie MSP, Cathie	Lab	null
Crawford JP MSP, Bruce	SNP	SNP
Cunningham MSP, Roseanna	SNP	SNP
Curran MSP, Ms Margaret	Lab	null
