Selecting NULL values.

Sometimes NULL values are given in tables, this might be because the data is unknown or is inappropriate. In the Parliament database a NULL value for party in the MSP table indicates that the MSP concerned is not a member of any of the parties. In the party table a NULL value is used where the party does not have an official leader - or I couldn't find one. I rather like it that the Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party don't seem to have leaders - and it suits my purposes.
We can use the phrase IS NULL to pick out fields. We can use IS NOT NULL similarly.

1.
List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

Why we cannot use =
You might think that the phrase dept=NULL would work here but it doesn't - you can use the phrase dept IS NULL

select name 
  from teacher
    where dept is null

2.
Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

select teacher.name, dept.name
  from teacher inner join dept 
    on (teacher.dept=dept.id)

3.
Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

select teacher.name, dept.name
  from teacher left join dept
    on (teacher.dept=dept.id)


4.
Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

select teacher.name, dept.name
  from teacher right join dept
    on (teacher.dept=dept.id)

5.
Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

select name,
  coalesce (mobile, '07986 444 2266' ) as mobile
  from teacher

6.
Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

select teacher.name
  , coalesce (dept.name, 'None') as department
  from teacher left join dept
    on (teacher.dept=dept.id)

7.
Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

select count(teacher.id), count(mobile)
  from teacher
  
8.
Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

select dept.name, count(teacher.id)
  from teacher right join dept
    on (teacher.dept=dept.id)
      group by dept.name
      
 9.
Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

select name,
  case when dept in (1, 2)
       then 'Sci'
       else 'Art'
       end
   from teacher
   
 10.
Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

select name,
  case when dept in (1, 2)
       then 'Sci'
       when dept=3
       then 'Art'
       else 'None'
       end
  from teacher
